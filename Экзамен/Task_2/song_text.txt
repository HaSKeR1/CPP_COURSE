this is what falling in love feels like

2021
[Pre-Chorus]
Feel like sun on my skin
So this is love, I know it is

[Chorus]
I know it sounds super cliche
But you make me feel some type of way
This is fallin', fallin' in love
Yeah, mm-m-m-mm, yeah

[Verse]
I got a lot on my mind
Got some more on my plate
My baby got me looking forward to the end of the day
What you say, you and me
Just forget about the past, throw it in the trash?
What you say, you and me
Live the life we never had like we're never going back?

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel like sun on my skin
So this is love, I know it is

[Chorus]
I know it sounds super cliche
But you make me feel some type of way
This is fallin', fallin' in love
I know it sounds super cliche
But you make me feel some type of way
This is fallin', fallin' in love (Yeah)
This is fallin', falling in love
This is fallin', fallin' in love
